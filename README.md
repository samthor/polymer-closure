This is a demo project for [Polymer & the ClosureÂ Compiler](https://goo.gl/vPYfay).
If you'd like to undertake it for your own projects, be sure to read the blogpost!

The project showcases compiling a Polymer 1.x project with Google's Closure Compiler, giving you minified, compiled, and transpiled JavaScript inside your Polymer elements ðŸŽ‰

This is not a Google product.
It is available under an [Apache 2 LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Getting Started

Check out this repo, and run `npm install`-

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/samthor/polymer-closure.git
$ npm install
```

This will take a few seconds, and generate a compiled version of your code inside `dest/elements.min.js`.
By default, you'll see an error!
This is fine - it's just there to show off Polymer.

Now, use a webserver - e.g., `serve`, to make this folder available.
Load up [the default port on localhost](http://localhost:3000) and check out the compiled element!
